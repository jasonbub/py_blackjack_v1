# py_blackjack_v1
This a Black Jack game that I created as a milestone project during Python Bootcamp.   There are a number of things that need to be improved, but it was just supposed to be a quick couple of hour project.  It currently expects to run in ipython, otherwise it will error on the command prompt.
